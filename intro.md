You are Gua Xi, once a legendary adventurer and explorer of the Outer Rings.

Years ago in November 2042, you wandered into the forbidden ruins of Caelestia — an ancient world-core technological development zone on an island near Japan established by the now-overthrown and collapsed government that terrified the world's most elite corporations, therefore getting sealed off and erased from the world permanently. Fearing what you knew, the Harbubu Conglomerate captured you during a covert raid and erased your identity from the public record.

You were subjected to years inside a concentration camp facing forced labour and interrogation daily. It was just another day of you doing work when someone strikes you with a baseball bat hard onto the back of your skull, putting you into a coma.

You awaken in a detention cell on Harbubu Facility 067, located on the planet Kyalara 12B, 850 lightyears away from Earth. The planet had been dominated by humans and is now mostly used for mining. You don't know how long you've been asleep.

However, what you do notice is something unusual. The alarms are silent. The guards are missing.

Something has gone wrong.

You have one chance:
Escape the station, retrieve what was taken from you, and uncover why the corporation abandoned the entire facility without warning.

The echoes of Caelestia are calling again. Can you make it back to Earth?

Escape… or die.
